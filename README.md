Due to too many formulas, Gitbook's reading experience is very poor. It is recommended that you go to [Github] (https://github.com/Kivy-CN/Stanford-CS-229-CN) to download Markdown or HTML to read locally. A lot better, at least the formula is no problem.


My (@CycleUser)'s physical condition can't be distracted in the short term to continue Markdown's production (<https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/33593066>), and @飞龙 constantly translates new content is more beneficial The good ideas of the new friends to acquire new skills and new knowledge, if his energy is used to maintain the old documents, it is quite wasteful and not worthwhile.

So now leave the production tasks for the remaining chapters of the Markdown document to other partners who are interested in exploring and sharing.

If you are interested in joining us to participate in translation and maintenance and explore more, please launch a pull request via github to get involved!

This world needs more heroes.
